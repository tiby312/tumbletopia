### Goal:

Your goal is to immobilize your opponent before they immobilize you.

### General Gameplay:

You and your opponent have three units each. You take turns moving one of your units. On your turn, first you move a unit, then you place a wall. Your units are able to push walls they are adjacent to. If you move 2 spaces away, and then place a wall in where you started, this will trigger a wall explosion. When this happens, every space not occupied by fog, with a radius of 2 spaces will be filled with a wall.

### Starting position:

The starting position is randomized to be slightly different between games. There are 360 possible starting positions.
