Goal:

Your goal is the immobilize your opponent before they immobilize you.

General Gameplay:
You and your opponent have three units each. You take turns moving one of your units.
On your turn, first you move a unit, then you place a wall. If you move 2 spaces away, and then place
a wall in where you started, this will trigger a wall explosion. When this happens, every space
not occupied by fog, with a radius of 2 spaces will be filled with a wall.



Starting position:

The starting position is randomized to coax different gameplay.
One unit per team is randomly selected to be slightly further back than the rest.
Two outer hexes are selected at random to be removed from the game.
